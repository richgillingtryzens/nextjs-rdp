# Customers

There appears to be a few different ways to manage storefront profile from CT:

* REST API through Admin - This way seems to work but requires elevated privileges for the token running on server side when registering. It needs at least manage_customers.
* REST API - My Profile - This appears to be ideal, but honestly it doesn't seem to be working while it's in beta.
* GraphQL - I haven't tried this yet.
* NodeJS SDK - I'm steering clear of this for now, prefer to understand the API before switching to an abstraction.
